  "full_response": "I'll help you implement an efficient solution for finding the longest palindromic substring.\n\n## Algorithm Approach\nI'll implement the \"Expand Around Center\" approach, which is both efficient and easy to understand. The algorithm:\n1. For each position in the string, treat it as a potential center\n2. Expand around this center (both odd and even length palindromes)\n3.
